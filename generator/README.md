## History
This attempt has come up after some research. I've tried thinking of ways to create clean electricity. I sat down and thought to myself "what do we have on this planet and is not going to change?"
So after thinknig that I came up with the idea that if Earth will not be able to have life on it without the sun, why not manipulate the sun to our needs?
So I've started thinking on effects the sun has on us, and that included, amongst other things, weather. So I thought how could I possibly manipulate weather to my needs, and suddenly I recalled something from an old physics book I've read about a physicist who made a clock running on weather. I've asked myself "if you can run a clock with that, why not be able to rotate a generator?"
So here I was, sitting in front of the computer, searching the internet thoroughly, and then I found it. The mechanism behind the clock.

## Practice
### How does it work?
It works on expansion and contraction, but taking it to the extreme. There's a sealed metal bellows capsule. The capsule is filled with a highly-volatile gas compound, pressurised so much that some of it is being turned into liquid. This mixture of liquid and gas is highk sensitive to weather changes, and being trapped inside a cpasule that can only move a certain way, it creates linear motion. This linear motion loads a spring that's controlling the movement of the mechanism that runs the generator. The spring will be constantly reloaded due to weather changes that expand and contract the capsule, thus the generator will keep moving. A mechanism is required to make sure everything is working as efficiently as possible. The mechanism neds to use the linear motion to rotate the spring with losing the least amount of energy possible, and then using that same spring to rotate a set of gears which will eventually run the dynamo to create as much electricity as possible, maybe even using every single gear as a generator by itself that runs another generator mechanically.

### What do we need?
#### Physicists
This whole project is built around you, so it should be quite easy finding a way in. Calculate efficency, find the best setup for the machine, etc.

#### Chemists
We need you to find the best material (or compound) for filling the capsule. Requirements: gas, non-fossil and highly volatile.

#### Engineers
We need you to find a way of creating a mechanism to convert the linear motion from the capsule to as much electricity as possible.

#### Anything else that could help
If I didn't mention your field and you think you'd mightbe able to help. As said, this is a community project. Publicity is also very important, so feel free to publicise this project.
