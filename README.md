Weather-based electric generator research repository

## What is it all about?
### A little about global warming
Earth is warming. Our planet is facing a change that, if not stopped, will end human life.

### What is this project and why is it so relevant?
This project is all about making a generator that could use changes in weather to make electricity. No burning, no air pollution, no carbon emission. We could minimise our carbon footprint on this planet. The name is a combination of two words: weather+generator. With this we'd might be able to stop the world from changing so drastically, and leave a better world for the next generation.

## This is a community project
### It is run by humans, for humans
The reason this is open source is that the creator doesn't want it to be a business. This is something we are trying to do in order to try and stop this world from being too hot for our species. Money can't be taken into account. This is being run by the people who know and can help for those who can't.

### We need you
If you are an physicist who could help, or a chemist, or an engineer, please help us. None of us knows everything, and we could help each other. No one can do anything alone. Together we can change the world.
